Display multiple private and public Google Calendars

== Description ==

This plugin can display multiple private (and public) Google calendars with a shortcode, Gutenberg block or as a widget.

See the [webpage](https://michielvaneerd.github.io/privategooglecalendars/) for more information.

= Features =

* Access to _private_ (and public) calendars by using OAuth2 or an API key.
* Adjustable caching - this can greatly improve the performance.
* It uses the [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/) library to show the calendar and can be fully customized within the Gutenberg block, shorcode attributes and the widget settings.
* Calendar filtering.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/private-google-calendars` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->Private Google Calendars screen to configure the plugin
4. See the Help tab in the settings screen for information about setting up the OAuth2 access and using the shortcode and/or widget.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Important notes for users who upgraded to 20200902 and experience differences =

The 20200902 update makes it possible to display private and public Google calendars at the same time in the same widget, shortcode or Gutenberg block.
This update makes the plugin also more secure. Though tested thoroughly it can be possible you experience a difference. Here are some possible differences and ways to solve them.

* Public calendar isn't showing anymore: this can happen when you display a calendar that you also have added to your Google account but didn't select in the plugin settings page.
The solution is either remove the calendar from your Google account or select it in the settings.

= How can I override the calendar look? =

Create a child theme and enqueue a css file with a dependency on `pgc` for example:

`wp_enqueue_style('fullcalendar-override', get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/fullcalendar-override.css', ['pgc']);`

= I get a 'Token has been expired or revoked' error =

This usually means you don't have a valid access or refresh token anymore. This can only be solved by manually revoke access on the [Google Permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions) page and remove all plugin data.

= I get an 'Error: redirect_uri_mismatch' error when I want to authorize =

This means that you didn't add your current URL [YOURWEBSITE]/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=pgc to the authorized redirect URIs. See the [website](https://blog.michielvaneerd.nl/private-google-calendars/) for more information.

= W3 Total Cache =

If you use W3 Total Cache and have minify JS enabled, make sure that you do one of the following:
Choose "Combine only" in the "Minify" settings.
OR
Enter the following files in the "Never minify the following JS files" textbox: fullcalendar.min.js and locale-all.js. Make sure you add the full path to these files from the root of your installation, so if your Wordpress website is located in the wordpress directory, this will be:

`wordpress/wp-content/plugins/private-google-calendars/lib/fullcalendar4/core/main.min.js
wordpress/wp-content/plugins/private-google-calendars/lib/fullcalendar4/core/locales-all.min.js
wordpress/wp-content/plugins/private-google-calendars/lib/fullcalendar4/list/main.min.js
wordpress/wp-content/plugins/private-google-calendars/lib/fullcalendar4/timegrid/main.min.js`

== Changelog ==

= 20201204 =
* Conditionally load defines to prevent logs.

= 20200902 =
